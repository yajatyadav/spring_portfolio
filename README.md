## TBD [Spring Portfolio Starter](https://nighthawkcodingsociety.com/projectsearch/details/Spring%20Portfolio%20Starter)
Runtime link: TBD https://jportfolio.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/



## Visual thoughts
#### * Starter code should be fun and practical
#### * Organize with Bootstrap menu 
#### * Add some color and fun through VANTA Visuals (birds, halo, solar, net)
#### * Show some practical and fun links (hrefs) like Twitter, Git, YouTube
#### * Show student project specific links (hrefs) per page
#### * Show student TPT ideas
#### * Show student About me pages



## Getting started
#### * Clone project to IntelliJ
#### * Verify Project Structure to use a good Java JDK (adopt-openJ9-15) 
#### * Play or entry point is Main.java, look for play option in the tray.  This file enables Spring to load
#### * Java source (src/main/java) had Java files.  Find "controllers" path, these files enable HTTP route and HTML file relationship.  Note, html 
#### * HTML source (src/main/resources) had templates and supporting files.  Find index.html as this file is launched by default in Spring.  Other HTML files are loaded by building a "@Controller"



## IDE management
#### * A ".gitignore" can teach a Developer a lot about Java runtime.  A target directory is created when you press play button, byte code is generated and files are moved into this location.
#### * A "pom.xml" file can teach you a lot about Java dependencies.  This is similar to "requirements.txt" file in Python.  It manages packages and dependencies.

# Harry test reflection
#  Part A : 13/15
# Part B:11/12
# Part A Q6
# Reflection: I initially thought that int len required some input or variable in order for the method to work, thus I thought that 1 couldn’t work. Three couldn’t work because   # the attributes are not double type. After looking back, I realized that int len was just an attribute that worked just like int w, int h, or int d. Thus, the answer should be 1 # and 2 only. 
#
# Part A Q15
# Reflection: I initially thought that variables can’t be redefined in java. However, it turns that it can’t redefined in the same method. Plus, I should’ve saw that in my answer # there was nothing to define the attribute. Thus, the only logical answer is E
#
# Part B Q1
# Reflection: I thought that 1 and 2 were being treated as integers so I added them together. It turns that += treats 1 and 2 as strings even without quotation marks. This makes D # the right answer.
